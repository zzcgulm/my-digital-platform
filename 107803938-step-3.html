                          <p>The Janet Community site is a way to get expert answers to your questions and queries regarding Janet products or in the areas that the company works in. It is also an opportunity for you to engage and collaborate with your peers and experts in the field and areas that they are passionate about.</p>
                          <h3>User Accounts</h3>
                          <p>We store the personal information that you give us so that you can access the community sites and your services and products, if you chose to link this information together.  </p>
                          <p>You can update or delete your information as you or your organisation require. Any relevant Janet systems will be informed of the change. Your information will only be shared with a third-party if they are subcontracted to provide a specific Janet service that you subscribe to. If necessary, the information will be passed onto the police or law enforcement authorities.  Otherwise we will not share your data with third parties.  </p>
                          <p>If you delete your Community account, we will keep the details for four weeks before deleting them. This is just in case a mistake has been made and the account needs to be recreated. After this, the account will be removed. You will need to delete your information for each product or service if your information is stored by them. You can use the Community site to delete your accounts from other products and services or contact <a href="mailto:service@ja.net" rel="nofollow">service@ja.net</a>.</p>
                          <p>Janet asks that you treat the site with respect. We do not tolerate bad language, abusive behaviour, personal attacks, or any of the activities prohibited by the existing <a href="https://community.ja.net/library/acceptable-use-policy" rel="nofollow">Janet Acceptable Use Policy</a>. If you come across any occurrences of this, please contact Janet via <a href="mailto:service@ja.net" rel="nofollow">service@ja.net</a>. Janet reserves the right to block a user account if that account is not being used in accordance with these principles.</p>
                          <h3>User Login</h3>
                          <p>You can log in either with a Federated account or by registering on the Community site.</p>
                          <p>If you link the two accounts together, you will need to login with your Federated account. If you do not, we will assume that you are no longer with the organisation and disable the link. We will keep the information required to re-create the link for four weeks in case this is a mistake.</p>
                          <p>You can always re-enable the link by logging in with your Federated account and re-associating the link.</p>
